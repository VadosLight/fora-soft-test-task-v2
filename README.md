# fora-soft-test-task
 
As a part of the test task, you need to develop a simple JavaScript application â€“ text chat room:

* After opening a page, user should enter his name
* After entering the name user should join new chat room
* There can be several chat rooms at the same time
* User can copy link to the room and send to another user to invite him
* User can send text messages to the chat and all users in the chat will see message
* Users should see who sent message to the chat and when
* Users should see who is in the chat room right now


You will have an advantage in the competition for this position if you add possibility to start
video streaming from users webcamera, so other participants of the chat room will see video and
audio from that user.

Your solution should:
1. Be written primarily in JavaScript
2. Be well commented
3. Use OOP practices
4. Use node.js for the server side
5. Use socket.io for communication between the client and the server
6. Use React JS for UI
7. Use WebRTC for the video chat part
